Writing Organized and Formatted (Encrypted) Data Locally.

The reason I started working on the project was because of a school project revolving games. 
As time past I made some simple writing and reading from a file and thought that the concept was pretty cool.

I wanted to take it to the next step though, push my limits as far as possible. I'm not the most experienced programmer out there.
In fact I only began a year ago, but I still want to keep learning.
