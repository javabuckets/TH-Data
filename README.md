# TH-Data
Writing Organized and Formatted (Encrypted) Data Locally.

The reason I started working on the project was because of a mere school project revolving games. 
As time past I made some simple writing and reading from a file and thought that the concept was pretty cool.

I wanted to take it to the next step though, push my limits as far as possible. I'm not the best programmer out there.
In fact I only just really began. But never the less I love it and I want to learn more and more. 

With that said, I will strive to become better, I will keep making projects revolving around these type of things. 

Catch ya later!
